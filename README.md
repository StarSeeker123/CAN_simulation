# CAN_simulation


The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a method  method of communication between electronic devices embedded in a vehicle. Originally invented by Bosch and later codified into the ISO11898-1 standard, CAN defines the data link and physical layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, providing a low-level networking solution for high-speed in-vehicle communications. In this project, the following sensors will be connected:

1. Linear Varible Differential Transformer
2. RPM sensors
3. Temperature sensor.
4. Accelerometers.
5. Rollover sensors

The software used here is from Genivi. The link to the github repository  is given below.
