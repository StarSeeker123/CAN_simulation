# CAN_simulation


The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a method  method of communication between electronic devices embedded in a vehicle. Originally invented by Bosch and later codified into the ISO11898-1 standard, CAN defines the data link and physical layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, providing a low-level networking solution for high-speed in-vehicle communications. In this project, the following sensors will be connected:

1. Linear Varible Differential Transformer
2. RPM sensors
3. Temperature sensor.
4. Accelerometers.
5. Rollover sensors

The vehicle network toolbox from MATLAB Simulink is used for the above simulation
